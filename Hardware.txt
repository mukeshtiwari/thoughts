Think about how to design Hardware language in Coq/Idris/Agda. Take the advantage of dependent
type system. First part will specification and simulation and later on generating the VHDL or Verilog code.

Survey software bugs and use static analysis to eliminate them. Some most common bugs are int overflow, off by one,
stack overflow, buffer overflow. Their impact on economy from security point of view.

Compiler optimization ( Replace a program fragment by another based on Denotational Semantic ).

Design a Domain Specific language for Cryptography ( Think more about this ).
